# Machine-Learning


Step 1. Divide the available data into “Learning”, “Validation” and “Test” splits, using Kfold cross validation.
Step 2. Create your data instances, by concatenating “K” consecutive measurements from a
users.
Step 3. Use a machine learning model to predict the users’ activity, based in the data created
in Step 2.
Step 4. Obtain the corresponding ROC curves, for each class. Also, provide the accuracy
value per class and the overall value.
Step 5. Find the importance of the X, Y and Z features to predict each activity.
Step 6. Repeat the experiments from Step 1-5, but using the subjects “ID” as the dependent
variable. The hypothesis is: “Is it possible to identify a subject based on his activity
measurements?”
Step 7. Both for the “Activity” and “ID” experiments, identify the instances in the test set
that are particularly hard to classify. What characterizes such instances?
